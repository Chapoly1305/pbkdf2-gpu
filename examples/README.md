This folder contains example LUKS partition headers and password lists for testing/benchmarking lukscrack-gpu.

Each partition header is labeled with its password in the filename (`<password>.luks`). `<password>-<count>.pwlist` is a password list containing `<count> - 1` arbitrary passwords followed by `<password>`.
